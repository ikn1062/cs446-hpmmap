***** Kernel compatibility *****

To use HPMMAP, you must have the Linux Hot Add/Remove features enabled in your
kernel


***** Building HPMMAP *****

(1) cd <hpmmap dir>/mod;
(2) Set LINUX_KERN to the appropriate path in the Makefile
(3) make


***** Installing HPMMAP *****
(1) cd <hpmmap dir>/mod;
(2) ./reload_mod.sh (requires root)


***** Allocating memory to HPMMAP *****
(1) cd <hpmmap dir>/utils;
(2) make;
(3) Use the mem_ctrl utility to offline/online memory for HPMMAP use. (requires root)


NOTE: Each time you add memory to / remove memory from HPMMAP, you are adding /
removing a single memory pool. Memory pools are variable in size, and are added
/ removed with the mem_ctrl utility.

The consistent way to manage memory pools is to use the -A and -R options to
mem_ctrl. For example, if you want to add a memory pool of 1GB (2^30 bytes)
to HPMMAP, you issue the command:

./mem_ctrl -A 30 [-n <numa node>]

Then, to remove the memory from HPMMAP and give it back to Linux, you run:

./mem_ctrl -R 30 [-n <numa node>]


The mem_ctrl command also accepts -a and -r options to add/remove individual
memory blocks. These modes are not recommended because the block size can be
system dependent, but on many systems they will be 128MB (order 27). This means
that the following two commands are equivalent in these systems:

./mem_ctrl -A 27 -n 0
./mem_ctrl -a 1 -n 0

as well as

./mem_ctrl -R 27 -n 0
./mem_ctrl -r 1 -n 0

Also note that the page sizes supported by HPMMAP are limited by the maximum
pool size that you have allocated. For example, if the largest pool size you've
allocated is less than order 30, you will not be able to use 1GB pages
regardless of whether 1GB page support has been compiled in the kernel module.

Finally, use the -s option to see the status of all memory blocks on the system.
Blocks listed as OFFLINE are available for HPMMAP use, while blocks listed as
ONLINE can be removed but are currently under Linux control.


***** Monitoring HPMMAP memory pools *****
The files /proc/hpmmap/zone{0,...,n} are provided to give information about the
status of HPMMAP memory pools. There is one file for each NUMA node on your
system.


***** Running applications *****
Use the utils/launcher utility to launch applications on HPMMAP.

For example:
<hpmmap dir>/utils/launcher ls

The permissions you set on /dev/hpmmap determine the permissions needed to run
applications on HPMMAP


***** Other info *****

The file mod/hpmmap.h has a couple of compile time features that may be selected
to modify the behavior of HPMMAP.
